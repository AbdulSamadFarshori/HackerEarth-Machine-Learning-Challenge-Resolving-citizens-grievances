# HackerEarth-Machine-Learning-Challenge-Resolving-citizens-grievances

## Data Selection
This Data was provided by HackerEarth, which was a part of this Hackathon.

## Preprocessing data:
Data Various Data Preprocessing Techniques are used to Clean the Data.

Handling the Categorical data with Dummy Varibles and Count Encoding.
Extracting informative data from appno column like case starting date and create a new feature from it.
Feature Engineering create a new feature from existing features like combining issues and creating no of issues, get year column by deducting judgementdate with startingdate. 
Visualization
For this part, I used Matplotlib which is most popular visualisation libraries available.
To get better insightes from the Data.
Feature selection i use Filter and Wrapper technique for Filter i use chi square test and for Wrapper i use recursive method
## Modeling
I used different machine learning classification alhgorithm like Logistic Regression, K-NN, Support Vector Machine, Navie Bayes, Random Forest, Voting Classifier and XGBOOST.
Among that XGBOOST performed the Best.
